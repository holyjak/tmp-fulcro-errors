= Appendix: Fulcro Errors and Warnings, Explained

== Fulcro warning and error logs

=== Warnings

==== application

[[cannot-unmount-application]]Cannot umount application because either the umount function is missing or the node was not recorded. Perhaps it wasn't mounted?::
TODO

==== components

[[get-ident-with-nil-props]]get-ident was invoked on  `(component-name x)`  with nil props (this could mean it wasn't yet mounted):  `x`::
TODO

[[get-ident-invalid-ident]]get-ident returned an invalid ident: `id` `(:displayName (component-options class))`::
TODO

[[get-ident-invalid-class]]get-ident called with something that is either not a class or does not implement ident:  `class`::
TODO

[[react-key-not-simple-scalar]]React key for  `(component-name class)`  is not a simple scalar value. This could cause spurious component remounts.::
TODO

[[string-ref-not-function]]String ref on  `(component-name class)`  should be a function.::
TODO

[[constant-ident-no-initial-state]]Component `(component-name c)` has a constant ident (id in the ident is not nil for empty props), but it has no initial state. This could cause this component's props to appear as nil unless you have a mutation or load that connects it to the graph after application startup.::
TODO

[[initial-state-incomplete]]Component `(component-name c)` does not INCLUDE initial state for `(component-name target)` at join key `k` ; however,  `(component-name target)` HAS initial state. This probably means your initial state graph is incomplete and props on `(component-name target)` will be nil.::
TODO

==== data_fetch

[[union-needs-more-children]]Unions are not designed to be used with fewer than two children. Check your calls to Fulcro
        load functions where the :without set contains  `(pr-str union-key)`::
TODO

[[boolean-marker-not-supported]]Boolean load marker no longer supported.::
TODO

[[data-load-targets-table]]Data load targets of two elements imply that you are targeting a table entry. That is probably incorrect. Normalization targets tables. Targeting is for creating missing edges, which are usually 3-tuples.::
TODO

[[dont-use-query-transform-default]]Query-transform-default is a dangerous option that can break general merge behaviors. Do not use it.::
TODO

==== data_targeting

[[target-unsuported-case]]Target processing found an unsupported case.::
TODO

==== denormalize

[[denormalize-loop-detected]]Loop detected in data graph at  `entity` . Recursive query stopped.::
TODO

[[denormalize-loop-detected-2]]Loop detected in data graph at  `e` . Recursive query stopped.::
TODO

==== dom

[[dom-type-mismatch]]There is a mismatch for the data type of the value on an input with value  `element-value` . This will cause the input to miss refreshes. In general you should force the :value of an input to
                be a string since that is how values are stored on most real DOM elements.::
TODO

==== durable_mutations

[[multiple-mutations-rewritten]]Write-through transactions with multiple mutations will be rewritten to submit one per mutation.::
TODO

==== dynamic_routing

[[routing-will-leave-deprecated]]DEPRECATED USE OF `:will-leave` to check for allowable routing. You should add :allow-route-change? to:  `(comp/component-name this)`::
TODO

[[routing-multiple-target-matches]]More than one route target matches `path`::
TODO

==== http_remote

[[transit-decode-failed]]Transit decode failed!::
TODO

==== tenacious_remote

[[remote-retry-limit-exceeded]]Tenacious remote exceeded retry limit `max-attempts`::
TODO

==== transit

[[transit-encode-failed]]Transit was unable to encode a value.::
TODO

==== tx_processing

[[tx-missing-ident]]Synchronous transaction was submitted on the app or a component without an ident. No UI refresh will happen.::
TODO

[[tx-remote-abort-not-supported]]Remote does not support abort. Clearing the queue, but a spurious result may still appear.::
TODO

==== ui_state_machines

[[uism-sm-not-in-state]]`(ex-info "" {})` Attempt to get an ASM path `ks` for a state machine that is not in Fulcro state. ASM ID:  `asm-id`::
TODO

[[uism-fallback-missing-event]]A fallback occurred, but no event was defined by the client. Sending generic ::uism/load-error event.::
TODO

[[uism-unexpected-event]]UNEXPECTED EVENT: Did not find a way to handle event `event-id` in the current active state: `current-state`::
TODO
